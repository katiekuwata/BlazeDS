     The contents of this file will be used to modify an existing flex-config.xml file so
     there is no need to maintain an entire config file.

     Each child directly under the root has two extra attributes - parent and action.

        parent - REQUIRED.  slash delimited path as to the parent node for the change
        action - replace, add, delete.  Default is replace.

    Local overrides are encouraged to be in flex-config.mods.local.xml

    THE BASE PARENT FOR flex-config.xml is "flex-config".
