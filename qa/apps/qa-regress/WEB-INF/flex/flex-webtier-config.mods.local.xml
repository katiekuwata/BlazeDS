<flex-webtier-config-mods-local>
    <!--
     The contents of this file will be used to make local mods to flex-server-config.xml after
     applying the flex-server-config.mods.xml file.  The intent of this file is like that of
     local.properties - to have some local only overrides.

     Each child directly under the root has two extra attributes - parent and action.

        parent - REQUIRED.  slash delimited path as to the parent node for the change
        action - replace, add, delete.  Default is replace.
        
        THE BASE PARENT FOR services-config.xml is "flex-webtier-config".
    -->
