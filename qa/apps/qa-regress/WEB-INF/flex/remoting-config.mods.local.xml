<remoting-config-mods-local>
    <!--
     The contents of this file will be used to make local mods to remoting-config.xml after
     applying the remoting-config.mods.xml file.  The intent of this file is like that of
     local.properties - to have some local only overrides.

     Each child directly under the root has two extra attributes - parent and action.

        parent - REQUIRED.  slash delimited path as to the parent node for the change
        action - replace, add, delete.  Default is replace.

        THE BASE PARENT FOR remoting-config is "service".
    -->
