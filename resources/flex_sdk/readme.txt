Adobe® Flex™ 3 SDK (software development kit)

Readme File

Flex 3 SDK is the base set of technologies and utilities that you use to create Flex 3 client applications. Flex 3 SDK consists of the Flex framework (ActionScript class library), the Flex compilers, the debugger, the MXML and ActionScript programming languages, and other utilities. Flex SDK also includes the source code for the Flex framework class library, enabling you to study the code of the classes as well as customize or extend them for your own use.

As a convenience to those developing and deploying enterprise-class Flex applications, the complete Flex 3 SDK is provided with this installation in the flex_sdk_3.zip file in the <blazeds_install_root>/resources/flex_sdk/ directory. To use the SDK, unzip the flex_sdk_3.zip to a known location.
