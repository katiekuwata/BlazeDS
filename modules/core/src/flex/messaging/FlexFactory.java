 * component instances (often called the "services layer" in a typical enterprise
 * architecture).  By implementing FlexFactory, you can configure a Flex
 * RemoteObject destination or a Flex Data Management Services assembler which
 * uses a Java object instance in your services layer rather than having FDS
 * create a new component instance.  In some cases, this means you avoid writing
 * glue code for each service you want to expose to flex clients.
