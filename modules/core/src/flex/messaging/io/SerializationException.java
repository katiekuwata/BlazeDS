/**
 * Typically signifies that a fatal exception happened during deserialization or
 * serialization. The messaging framework should try to get a meaningful
 * message back to the client in a response, however this is not always possible,
 * especially for batched AMF messages, so at the very least the error should be 
 * logged.
 * 
 * A special sub-class RecoverableSerializationException can be thrown for non-fatal
 * serialization exceptions.
