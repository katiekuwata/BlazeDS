 * A response message should have two instances of this class among its headers,
 * headers[MPII] - info for the client to server message,
 * headers[MPIO] - info for the response message from server to client.
 * A pushed message will have an extra headers and its headers will represent,

 * headers[MPIO] - info for the pushed message from server to client,
 * headers[MPIP] - info for the message from the client that caused the push message
