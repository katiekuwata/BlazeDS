# Error and details messages for LocalizedMessageExceptions are stored in the following format:
# Error message: {number}[-{variant}]={message}
# Details message: {number}[-{variant}]-details={details}
#
# Vendor error numbers start at 20000.
#
# Error numbers are chosen by taking the next available value in a numeric sequence. 
# Each functional component or group of components should claim a unique block of 50
# numbers to use for error and details messages. If this initial set of 50 values
# are exhausted, the component should claim the next available block of 50 values for
# its use. This means that an error-ridden component may well use a disjoint set of 
# error numbers. Here's an example:
# Feature		Error numbers claimed
# -----------------------------------
# Tomcat		20050-20099
# JRun			20100-20149
# Tomcat		20150-20199 <- Tomcat exhausted its first block, so it claims the next
#							   available block of 50 values for its continued use.
#
# Constants to lookup error/details strings by 'number', and optional 'variant', 
# should be defined in the classes that use them. When a class needs to define a new
# error and/or details string, add the necessary string(s) to this file using the next
# available numeric value in the corresponding range.
#
# The structure of this file should be maintained according to increasing error number. This 
# means that for features that throw many errors, blocks of corresponding message strings
# won't necessarily be contiguous, but this simplifies identifying the starting value for
# the next available block of values and simplifies validation that duplicate error numbers 
# are not being used.
# * Caution: Reusing a property key doesn't generate any error, so watch for typos. 
#			 The last defined property with a duplicate key clobbers the earlier values.
